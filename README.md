# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

###This repositorie has been created to complete the Getting and Cleaning Data course from Johns Hopkings University through Coursera.

>In this repo you will find:

* A readme.md file that explains what you can find in this repo, and an explination         of the code in performing_script.R
* A code book that describes the variables, the data, and work performed 
        to clean up the data, file codeBook.md
* A tidy data set which is the outcome of the process in the performing_analysis.R         script, file tidydata.txt 

##Task##
In this projec the student should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
